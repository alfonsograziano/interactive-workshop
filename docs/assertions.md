# A02 Assertions

Assertions are fundamental to testing in Node.js, serving as the building blocks for **validating code functionality**. They help ensure that your code behaves as expected under various conditions.

- Objective: Learn to use Node.js built-in assertions to test sum and sumAsync functions.
- Context: Functions are located in `src/index.js`, with tests in `./test/index.test.js`.
- Task: Write tests using the provided assertions, following the guidelines in the comments.

Understanding and implementing assertions correctly is key to developing robust tests for your applications.

---

## The problem

- Import Necessary Modules: Begin by importing the assert and test modules, along with the functions to be tested.
- Write Test Cases: Follow the instructions and use assertions to validate the behavior of the functions
- Running Tests: Execute your tests using node --test to ensure your code meets the specified conditions.
- ðŸ’¡ The assert syntax is similar to the example, you just need to customize it
